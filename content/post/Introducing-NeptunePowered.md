## What is [NeptunePowered](http://www.neptunepowered.org/)?
  NeptunePowered is a team dedicated to making server owners lives easier.

## What is Neptune?
  Neptune is a work-in-progress implementation of CanaryLib for 'Vanilla' Minecraft.
  It will be implemented using [Mixin](https://github.com/SpongePowered/Mixin).
  Neptune will also use mcp mappings.
  
## Why?
  I am a big supporter of Canary, and feel (in comparison to other server mods) Canary lacks a great implementation.
  This is why I am creating Neptune.
  
## What about Arno?
  I am not stopping development of Arno, infact Arno has been acquired by NeptunePowered.
  
## What is Arno?
  Arno is a similar product to Neptune, except from being implemented ontop Minecraft Forge.
